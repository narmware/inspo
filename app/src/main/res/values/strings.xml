    <string name="lorem_ipsum">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of
        type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
        typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
